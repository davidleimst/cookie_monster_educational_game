# Defeat the Cooke Monster (Educational Game)

## Background

An educational game created at the Human-Centered-Computing Research for the "The Long Night of Science" at Freie Universität, providing playful information about dark patterns in consent forms. 

## Description

The player is required to pass 10 levels, where within each one the "Cookie Monster" deploys a dark pattern to get the user to consent to their data being collected. If a level is failed, a cookie is lost. If all three cookies are gone, the player has lost the game.

### Run game

A live version of the game can be accessed via Github Pages, or run locally by downloading this folder and starting "Index.html" within the "Docs" folder.

## Authors

The demonstrator was  conceptualized and designed by researchers of the [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html) research group at the Freie Univserität Berlin.
